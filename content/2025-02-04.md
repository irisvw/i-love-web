**Note:** [Selectors Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-3/#first-line) introduced the double-colon notation (`::`) to distinguish [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) from the single-colon (`:`) [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes). Browsers accept both `::first-line` and `:first-line`, which was introduced in CSS2.

`li:nth-of-type(10):has( [value="blauw"]:checked )`
